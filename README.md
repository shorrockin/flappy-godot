# Flappy Godot
A simple & straight-forward godot implementation of a flappy bird like game, 
just to kick the tires on godot a bit. No attempt to be accurate, mostly going from
memory on how the game works. All assets from [this](https://github.com/samuelcust/flappy-bird-assets/tree/master) repository. 

Playable on [itch.io](https://ebinflow.itch.io/flappy-godot).
